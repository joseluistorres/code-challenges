# LookBook

Create a simple lookbook app for a company. The lookbook should display images from the company's Instagram feed and provide a pleasant browsing experience, especially for tablet users. When it loads it will display the most recent image at the top at a large resolution, with thumbnails of older images below. The app should provide some mechanism for browsing the images.
We will be evaluating the functionality of the application, your solution to the problem and the quality of the code.
